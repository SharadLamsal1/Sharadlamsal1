## 👋 Hi, I'm Sharad Lamsal

I'm a Civil Engineering graduate student at the University of Virginia with a focus on transportation systems, data analytics, and spatial modeling. My passion lies in combining **transportation engineering**, **data science**, and **GIS** to create smart, equitable, and efficient mobility solutions.

🔍 Currently, I’m working on research at the Virginia Transportation Research Council, analyzing **intersection sight distance** using **LiDAR data**, **ArcGIS Pro**, and **Python** to understand the impacts of design standards in urban environments.

🚀 I enjoy developing **data-driven tools and dashboards** that make complex transportation data more accessible and actionable. My recent projects include:
- A real-time crash trends dashboard for Virginia using **Python**, **Dash**, **PostgreSQL**, and **AWS**
- An ML-powered risk rating pipeline using **Python**, **R**, and **Power BI**
- Geospatial safety analysis and visualization using **ArcGIS Pro** and **ArcGIS Online**

🛠️ Tools & Technologies I use:
- **Languages**: Python, R, MATLAB, SQL
- **Data & Visualization**: Pandas, Plotly, Dash, Power BI, Tableau
- **GIS**: ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, QGIS
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (EC2, RDS, S3), Docker, Git & GitHub
- **Modeling**: TransCAD, PTV Vistro/Vissim, Civil 3D

📌 I'm actively building my portfolio with new projects in transportation analytics, streamlit dashboards, and ML applications in mobility and planning.
